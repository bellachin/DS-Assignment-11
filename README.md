# DS-Assignment-11 Description

This code implements a series of data preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation steps to predict diabetes status based on a variety of health metrics. Initially, the dataset is loaded and explored using the `pandas` library, which provides methods for checking the dimensions and summary statistics of the data. Data visualization is done with `matplotlib` and `seaborn` to create histograms and pairwise plots, revealing key patterns like skewed distributions and correlations. The dataset is then evaluated for missing values and converted to appropriate data types to ensure correct handling. Following this, the data is split into training and test sets, with feature scaling applied using `StandardScaler` from `sklearn` to normalize the numeric data. The core model is a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier, which is tuned using `GridSearchCV` for hyperparameter optimization. Cross-validation is performed to assess the model's performance, and the best model parameters and accuracy scores are displayed. The final model's performance is evaluated on the test set, and its quality is analyzed for overfitting or underfitting. This code utilizes key Python libraries such as `pandas` for data manipulation, `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for visualization, and `sklearn` for machine learning tasks like model fitting, cross-validation, and hyperparameter tuning.
